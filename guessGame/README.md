# Guess Game
As Julius Caesar said:
> divide et impera

In english words meaning divide and conquer, in python thinking way it means: if you have a problem, its better use methods and classes than just write the code to get the answer. Or is that I believe

We must always think in re use the code in the future and don't re invented the wheel again. So the best practice is separate the problem we have in small functional parts for gain flexibility, reliability and maintenence. And kill the bug before they born

In this project, I present to you a problem-game: You have to guess a number and prompt how many attempts you made for guess the number, I coded a simple way to play the game and then the same game but in OOP mode!
